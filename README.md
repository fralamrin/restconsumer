This is a simple rest client used to consume Posts informati√≥n from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

Information about posts is received in JSON format and converted to XML format.

In addition, a REST controller has been implemented. This controller can be used as an entry point to this application. 

In order to test it a postman collection has been created. It can be found at restcosumer/postman/rest-client.postman_collection.json

Notes: 

* Flow is simple, so no logs have been included in order to keep implementation clear.
* It is using Lombok for getter, setters, constructors,...

All feedbacks are welcome.

Thanks for your time.
